                <ul>
                        <p>We started with only a pile of parts but were able to assemble the base of the car pretty early.<br>
                            Our main struggle was figuring out how the dump mechanism should be put together. (DAY 1)</p>
                        <img class = "pics" 
                        src= "Pictures/IMG_5451.jpg"/>

                        <p>Kyle was able to set up both Maze 1 and Maze 2 with some cardboard and tape. (DAY 1)</p>
                        <img class = "pics"
                        src = "Pictures/Copy of Maze1.jpg"/>
                        <img class = "pics"
                        src = "Pictures/maze 2.jpg"/>

                        <p>When our dumptruck body was complete, Kyle took a mini photoshoot :) <br>
                            The longest setback was screwing things together with the tiny hex-nuts and bolts. (DAY 2)</p>
                        <img class = "pics"
                        src = "Pictures/KyleFullCarFloor.png"/>

                        src = "Pictures/KyleArduinoCloseUp.png"/>

                        <p>Then, Kyle troubleshooted and got the status LED! (DAY 2)</p>
                        <img class = "pics"
                        src = "Pictures/statusLED.jpg"/>

                        <p>Here are some videos from Tier 1! (DAY 2)</p>

                        <p>To complete Tier 2 of the Prototype Build, Kyle assembled a joystick controller. (DAY 2)</p>

                        <p>For Tier 3, the sensor was added to the front of the car to make it drive autonomously. (DAY 3)</p>
                        <img class = "pics"
                        src = "Pictures/top.png"/>

                        <p>Here are some videos from Tier 3! (DAY 3)</p>

                        <p>When designing the back wheels Patrick was having trouble with keeping the rims thin.<br>
                        Eventually he was able to do an extruded cut in two directions and got the job done. (DAY 2)</p>
                        <img class = "pics"
                        src = "Pictures/Arduibros_Wheel.jpg"/>

                        src = "Pictures/Screenshot Arduibros Wheel.jpg"/>

                        <p>The L Bracket was not so simple. Jose had to start over a couple times because there were missing curves after completing the part.<br>
                        After a couple redos he was able to finish it. (DAY 2)</p>
                        <img class = "pics"
                        src = "Pictures/LBracketScreenshot.jpg"/>
                    
                        <p>The Ball Caster was tough to visualize, let alone design.<br> 
                        After utilizing the revolve tool and creating multiple center-lines, we got it done. (DAY 2)</p>
                        <img class = "pics"
                        src = "Pictures/BallCaster.jpg"/>

                        <p>We experienced a major setback when Jose was forced to restart his CAD assebly.<br>
                        For whatever reason the file had accidently been deleted :( (DAY 3)</p>
                        <img class = "pics"
                        src = "Pictures/JoseCADrestart"/>

                        <p>We struggled figuring out the drawing files and how to get the dimensions right.</p>
                        <img class = "pics"
                        src = "Pictures/BallCasterDrawing.jpg"/>

                        src = "Pictures/lbracketdrawing.jpg"/>

                        <p>Finally, to display our journey for this weekend, Patrick utilized html, css, and javascript to make a website.<br>
                        That's what you're looking at right now! (DAY 2/3)</p>
